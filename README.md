Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019.

The data file included provides all the information to find out more about the hosts, availability and more. This is a public dataset, and the original source can be found here (http://insideairbnb.com/)

Of interest to me was the number of available rooms in New York City, how much it would cost per night, and if that cost changed depending on the location and type of room available.

Files included:
* The dataset used
